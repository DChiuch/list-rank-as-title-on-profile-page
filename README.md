# List "Rank" as "Title" on Profile Page

Some users (including myself) don't really use the "Rank" feature as a member ranking, but instead let their users set their own text for the rank, providing more of a member title feature. However, the profile page will still list this as a "Rank", leading to confusion.

This plugin replaces the word "Rank" with whatever you have set for the custom rank name in your language settings – in a default installation this is "Title" – saving you the trouble of having to split your website language or edit a template, just to change a string.
